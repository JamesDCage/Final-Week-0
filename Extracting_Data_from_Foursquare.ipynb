First, Foursquare has a size limit (about 10,000 square kilometers). Georgia is much larger. Also, Foursquare will only return 100 venues per request (at least with my account type). My code handles these issues by dividing the box into smaller sub-boxes until all boxes are small enough for Foursquare. Then every time a query on a sub-box returns 100 results, the sub-box is split into 4 pieces and a new query is run on each one. This process repeats until all queries return <100 results. Any queries with 100 results are thrown away to avoid duplication.\n","\n","Let's begin by drawing a large box around Georgia and requesting data.
